## Future Transition to MIT License

The ReactPyx maintainers intend to transition this project to the
MIT License once it reaches a more mature and stable state.

At that time, the repository will include a standard MIT LICENSE file and
this temporary notice will be removed.

Until that transition happens, this temporary license supersedes any other
license text or references in the repository.

For questions about licensing or commercial use, please contact the
project maintainers via the GitHub repository issues or discussions.
